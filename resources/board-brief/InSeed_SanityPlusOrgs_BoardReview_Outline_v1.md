# InSeed – Sanity+Orgs Board Review  
_A fast, honest lens on whether our org is still sane_

> Working draft. Board facing outline for a lighter weight service
> that can precede or follow a full CoScend Org Upgrade.

---

## 1. What this is

Sanity+Orgs Board Review is a **short, high candour engagement** for boards and top executives who want an outside view on one question:

> Are we still structurally sane for the world we are entering?

It does not sell transformation by default.  
It tells the truth first.

---

## 2. Who this is for

Typical triggers:

- The board is hearing conflicting signals about AI, remote work, talent flight.  
- The CEO feels the org is "busy but stuck" and wants language to describe why.  
- Key staff (including people like Alex) are anxious about their future in the org.  
- There is a sense that "the org chart and reality do not match anymore".

Intended audience:

- Board of directors (or equivalent Steward circle)  
- CEO / Steward, CFO, CHRO / People lead, CIO / CTO  
- Occasionally a small number of invited "truth tellers" inside the org

---

## 3. Problems it surfaces

Common patterns we look for:

- **Pyramid lock:** critical decisions and flows are still stuck in a hierarchy that cannot keep up.  
- **Process brain waste:** people with strong process / systems thinking are used as "hands", not as co designers.  
- **AI theatre:** slides and slogans about AI with little real structural preparation.  
- **Guardrail gaps:** no clear view of how AI will be constrained, supervised or reversed when it misfires.  
- **Sanity fog:** no one can clearly state:
  - how work actually flows,  
  - who truly stewards what,  
  - how the org would evolve if conditions change.

The output is not a generic "maturity score".  
It is a tailored view of where **sanity holds** and where it is **wearing thin**.

## 4. What we actually do

Sanity+Orgs Board Review is usually a **2–3 week** pulse, built around four moves:

1. **Listen**  
   - Short, focused conversations with:
     - CEO / Steward  
     - a subset of board members  
     - selected executives and "Alex type" process thinkers  
   - Capture how each group describes:
     - the future they expect,  
     - the org they think they have,  
     - the org they fear they actually have.

2. **Map**  
   - Sketch a simple **org-as-flows** map:
     - key customer flows,  
     - decision flows,  
     - AI / automation touch points,  
     - places where one person or role is a single point of failure.  

3. **Contrast**  
   - Hold your current picture up against:
     - emerging CoNeural / CoScend patterns,  
     - lessons from CoSteward / Hybrid Society work,  
     - real stories like "Alex" that show what is at stake for staff.  

4. **Tell the truth**  
   - Deliver a board-level briefing that:
     - names the main sanity risks and blind spots,  
     - highlights strengths you might be underusing,  
     - outlines a few concrete options (including "do nothing, eyes open").  

---

## 5. Outputs

The typical deliverables are:

1. **Sanity+Orgs Board Brief (deck or memo)**  
   - A clear narrative that a board can read in under an hour.  
   - Specific to your org, not generic management-speak.  
   - Red, amber, green flags on:
     - structure,  
     - talent usage (especially process thinkers),  
     - AI readiness and guardrails,  
     - resilience and evolvability.

2. **Org-as-Flows Sketch**  
   - One or two pages showing:
     - how work actually moves,  
     - where things knot up,  
     - where AI is or could be involved,  
     - where responsibility is ambiguous.

3. **Options Note**  
   - A short, non-pressuring view of what you *could* do next:
     - run a pilot CoScend Org Upgrade,  
     - commission a deeper CoSteward / Accord pack,  
     - focus first on a specific tension (for example staff anxiety about AI).

We do not assume you will choose any of these.  
The aim is to make your **choices conscious**.

## 6. How this relates to CoScend Org Upgrade

Sanity+Orgs Board Review can:

- Come **before** CoScend, as a low commitment first look, or  
- Come **after** a first CoScend wave, as a way to check:
  - "Are we staying sane?"  
  - "Where did reality drift from the design?"  

In both cases, it speaks the same language:

- Stewards rather than pure bosses.  
- CoCells and flows rather than boxes on a chart.  
- Process thinkers (Alex types) as structural assets, not expendable labour.

---

## 7. Tone and stance

This is not:

- a compliance audit,  
- a "gotcha" exercise,  
- or a sales pitch disguised as a review.

It is:

- a structured way to tell the truth,  
- a way to see whether the org you have  
  matches the world you say you are preparing for.

InSeed and allies show up as **stewards of sanity**,  
not as vendors closing a deal.

---

## 8. Next steps

When turned into a public facing asset, this outline will support:

- A simple self-check for boards:  
  "Do we need a Sanity+Orgs Review in the next 12 months?"  
- A clear invitation to:
  - request a review, or  
  - at least start a structured internal conversation.  

Internally, this outline will also feed:

- CoSteward materials on board / Steward education,  
- CoAudit patterns for sanity checks,  
- GIBindex entries for Sanity+Orgs, CoScend, CoNeural Org.
