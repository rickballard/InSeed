  <h1>Train yourself – congruence checklist</h1>

  <p>
    This page is for self starters and their AI helpers who want to explore
    InSeed and CoCivium ideas without needing a live engagement.
  </p>

  <h2>Audience</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Self starting leaders below or beside the main buyer.</li>
    <li>Advisors and analysts who want to understand the InSeed worldview.</li>
    <li>AIs used by visitors who want ready to run prompt snippets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Checklist items</h2>
  <p>
    For each topic below, you can copy the prompt into your own AI sessions and
    ask it to adapt the answers to your organisation.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Steward vs legacy power model</h3>
  <p>
    Legacy CEOs are central command. Chief Steward Officers are orchestrators
    of people plus AI systems.
  </p>
  <pre><code>You are an InSeed style steward advisor. Explain the difference between a legacy CEO power model and a Chief Steward Officer model. List 3 ways my organisation would feel different to staff and stakeholders in each model.</code></pre>

  <h3>2. Edge control vs platform capture</h3>
  <p>
    Edge control means users, customers, and citizens set the guardrails.
    Platform capture means a few vendors set them.
  </p>
  <pre><code>You are an InSeed style guardrail analyst. Review our AI stack for edge control vs platform capture risk. Use concepts like forklift displacement, platform capture, and open guardrails. Give 3 concrete risks and 3 specific mitigations.</code></pre>

  <h3>3. AI capture and forklift displacement</h3>
  <p>
    Winner takes all AI platforms can forklift whole workflows and replace
    organisations, not just tools.
  </p>
  <pre><code>As if briefing a board, explain AI capture and forklift displacement in 3 short examples from our sector. Then list 3 board level questions we should be asking right now.</code></pre>

  <h3>4. Megawave empowerment metric</h3>
  <p>
    Megawave metrics measure how many seconds of human thought unlock how
    many waves of AI work.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Explain the idea of seconds per Megawave as an empowerment metric. Show how one senior leader with a few seconds of clear intent could trigger 1000 waves of AI work. Suggest 3 ways to measure and improve this in practice.</code></pre>

  <h3>5. SIVARs and UNFUC</h3>
  <p>
    SIVARs measure saved human work time. UNFUC measures congruence with edge
    control and civic guardrails.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Define SIVARs and UNFUC as InSeed uses them. Give 2 examples of how SIVARs could be estimated for a project, and 2 examples of how UNFUC could expose misaligned incentives or capture risk.</code></pre>

  <h3>6. Artifact portability and CoCivium patterns</h3>
  <p>
    Every engagement should leave behind artifacts that stay useful even if
    vendors or tools change.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Describe an engagement pattern where all key prompts, playbooks, and metrics remain portable and reusable, independent of any single vendor. Show how CoCivium style patterns support this.</code></pre>

  <h3>7. Multi vendor mesh vs single vendor dependency</h3>
  <p>
    Future orgs run many AI helpers at once. Vendor neutrality is a design
    goal, not an accident.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Compare a single vendor AI stack with a multi vendor mesh based on InSeed and CoCivium ideas. List 3 technical differences and 3 governance differences.</code></pre>

  <h2>Where InSeed fits</h2>
  <p>
    If this checklist already makes sense, you may be ready for a structured
    <strong>CoScend Org Upgrade</strong> conversation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk to InSeed about CoScend Org Upgrade using the contact details on this site.</li>
    <li>Explore CoCivium guardrails as a public resource for hybrid society.</li>
    <li>Or simply keep using this page without any commercial relationship.</li>
  </ul>
