# CoBus Advisory – Brand Triad Front Doors  
InSeed.com • CoPolitic.org • GroupBuild.org/.com

## 1. Purpose

This advisory tells CoBus, Co1, and all CoSuite helpers how to treat the
three main “front-door” brands that sit around CoCivium and CoSuite:

- **InSeed.com** – strategy studio / founder context / capital & enterprise lens  
- **CoPolitic.org** – civic narrative, policy, and public-interest lens  
- **GroupBuild.org/.com** – collaborative build platform for projects, squads, and missions  

Whenever any CoSuite asset talks about “the public front doors” or links to
InSeed.com or CoPolitic.org, the default assumption is that **GroupBuild.org**
belongs in the same cluster, unless the context is deliberately narrow.

## 2. Default referencing pattern

When writing docs, manifests, or marketing copy:

- Use this **canonical snippet** (adapt text to tone, but keep the roles):  

  > Our public front doors currently include **InSeed.com** (strategy studio),  
  > **CoPolitic.org** (civic & policy narrative), and **GroupBuild.org**  
  > (collaborative build platform).

- If a passage already names **InSeed.com** as the only site, ask:
  - “Is this about Rick/strategy/enterprise?”  
  - If yes but the doc is CoSuite-wide, add CoPolitic.org and GroupBuild.org
    as the civic and collaborative counterparts.

- If a passage names **CoPolitic.org** by itself, ask:
  - “Is this describing *how* people organize and act?”  
  - If yes, add GroupBuild.org as “where they actually do it together,” and
    InSeed.com as the strategy studio behind the scenes.

- If we talk about **GroupBuild** first (e.g., GB session docs), add:
  - InSeed.com when the context is capital, governance, or enterprise strategy,  
  - CoPolitic.org when the context is civic legitimacy, democratic framing, or
    public-facing narratives.

## 3. How CoBus should route

CoBus and routing helpers should treat the triad as a **front-door cluster**:

- For **strategy / founder / investor** questions:
  - route to InSeed repo + any relevant CoIndex/CoCivium manifests.

- For **civic / policy / public narrative** questions:
  - route to CoPolitic repo + CoCivium constitution / CoTheoryCiv assets.

- For **collaborative build / squads / project tooling**:
  - route to GroupBuild repo + CoAgent/CoArena/CoCache where relevant.

When in doubt, CoBus may attach all three links and let downstream sessions
narrow based on their remit.

## 4. Relation to Codex & other helpers

- Codex and other future orchestration helpers should see the triad as:
  - three **entry points** for different types of humans,
  - but all ultimately wired back into the same CoSuite repo constellation.

- GroupBuild is the natural home for:
  - Codex environments that manage ongoing project work,
  - “build together” workflows, squad dashboards, and contributor journeys.

- InSeed.com and CoPolitic.org should primarily link to GroupBuild when
  inviting people to **participate**, not just to read or watch.

## 5. Open invitations for future waves

Future sessions (Co1, CoBus, CoSteward, GB, InSeed, CoPolitic) are invited to:

- add language variants and audience-specific snippets (e.g., investor decks vs.
  civic explainers vs. contributor onboarding),
- attach this advisory to:
  - brand style guides,
  - CoPortal manifests,
  - website scaffolds for all three domains,
- keep this file updated if the front-door set changes (new domains, mergers,
  or rebrandings).

Until revised, this advisory is the **canonical reference** for how the
front-door triad is described and linked across CoSuite.
