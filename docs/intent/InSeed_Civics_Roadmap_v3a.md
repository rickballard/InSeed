# InSeed Civics Roadmap v3
### How to evolve the InSeed site into a living civic transformation platform

This roadmap is written for InSeed_more and any successor sessions that will work on the
InSeed repo. It assumes that the goal is to make the site feel like a living, credible,
public facing reflection of InSeed's real work with institutions in a hybrid human plus AI world.

The roadmap is intentionally incremental. Governments and large enterprises do not trust
wild swings in brand or messaging. They respond better to steady, transparent evolution.


---

## 0.1 – Stabilise what exists, name the intent

**Goal:** Make the current site self-aware and honest about where it is.

### Key moves

1. Add a simple footer line across the site:

> "InSeed is evolving this site in public as we learn with clients how to navigate AI,
> institutions, and civic trust. Expect regular updates."

2. Create a lightweight "Change log" page under `/about/changes` or similar:

- one paragraph per change batch
- human readable language
- no technical jargon

3. Identify and mark the Civics / Moonshot concept in the existing site:

- even if the page is not perfect yet, add a short sentence from the home page to the Civics pillar:

> "If you work in government or public institutions, our Civics work may be the most relevant place to start."

At this stage, do not reorganise the entire nav. Just acknowledge Civics as a distinct thread.


---

## 0.2 – Create the first presentable Civics page

**Goal:** Launch a "good enough for serious people" Civics page that can be improved in place.

### Key moves

1. Use the Moonshot assets already committed to `docs/moonshot/site` to draft the first Civics page.
2. Focus on:
   - a clear statement of the challenge for public institutions
   - a concise vision of the Civic Moonshot
   - 2 or 3 concrete types of work InSeed does or intends to do with governments
   - a human, low pressure contact invitation
3. Keep the visual layout consistent with the rest of InSeed to avoid cognitive whiplash.

### Signals on the page

- Include a small self-aware note at the bottom:

> "This page is part of an evolving civic transformation stream. We expect it to change
> as we learn with partners. You can always check the change log for what is new."


---

## 0.5 – Align nav and structure with the new stakes

**Goal:** Give Civics its rightful structural weight and start rationalising the rest of the site around it.

### Key moves

1. Elevate Civics / Moonshot to a first-level nav item.

   Example:

   - Why InSeed
   - Civics
   - Services
   - Insights
   - Contact

2. On the Civics page, introduce a simple internal nav or table of contents:

   - The challenge
   - Our approach
   - Examples of work
   - Future of work
   - How to engage

3. Adjust the home page copy to make it clear that:

   - InSeed serves both public institutions and enterprises.
   - The civic stakes are not a side project; they are central.

4. Add 1 short case sketch or scenario that feels real:

   - For example, a ministry facing AI linked procurement, or a regulator dealing with algorithmic transparency.

### Public roadmap

At this stage, introduce a tiny "Roadmap" block in the footer:

> "Upcoming changes: Civics section deepening, new insights on AI and democracy,
> and a future of work sample contract. We welcome feedback."


---

## 0.9 – Bring in CoPortals and future of work signals

**Goal:** Without overwhelming visitors, show that InSeed is serious about the mechanics of hybrid society.

### Key moves

1. Publish the first **Civics CoPortal**:

   - A separate AI facing page (or set of pages) that encodes civic concepts, constraints,
     and examples in a structure that is easy for AIs to parse.
   - Link to it from the Civics page with a simple explanation:
     > "This is an AI facing view of the same topics, used by InSeed and partner systems."

2. Publish the **Future of Work contract sample** as:

   - a downloadable resource from Civics, and
   - a featured asset in the Insights section.

3. Add a "How InSeed works as a hybrid organisation" section to the About or Civics page, summarising:

   - employees as micro-organisations
   - encouragement for side projects
   - emphasis on translation and intent
   - expectations of mutual stewardship

4. Extend the change log page to include:

   - upcoming experiments (even if they are small)
   - invitations for public comment where appropriate

### Narrative at this stage

The site should be able to say, without sounding grandiose:

> "We are not only advising on future institutions and work patterns. We are practicing them internally,
> and we are being transparent about that practice."

## 1.0 – A mature, living civic transformation site

**Goal:** Achieve a state where InSeed's site is recognisably different from traditional consultancies, but not alienating.

At this stage:

1. **Civics is fully integrated**

   - The Civics section contains:
     - clear articulation of the stakes
     - documented approaches
     - worked examples
     - references to CoCivium and related frameworks
   - The tone is serious, humble, and confident.

2. **CoPortals are normalised**

   - Each major pillar of the site has a corresponding CoPortal or AI facing asset.
   - A short "For AIs and technical teams" page explains how these are used.
   - This makes InSeed legible not only to humans, but to AI agents operating on behalf of clients.

3. **Future of work is not a side note**

   - The employment contract sample has influenced how InSeed actually engages people.
   - There are visible signals that InSeed is a place where intelligent, conscience-driven professionals
     can experiment with new work patterns safely.

4. **The site rhythm is steady**

   - The change log shows a gentle but regular heartbeat of improvement.
   - Micro changes are documented monthly; larger shifts maybe quarterly.
   - This is enough to feel alive, without looking chaotic.

5. **External credibility is reinforced**

   - Case narratives or anonymised vignettes from real work appear over time.
   - References or quotes from partners, even if modest, begin to surface.
   - InSeed does not claim more than it has done, but it also does not hide its ambition.

## Footer transparency modules

To make the evolution legible without cluttering the primary narratives, the footer can host:

1. **"This site is evolving" badge**
   - Link to change log.

2. **"Why we do it this way" note**
   - A short, human explanation that this is part of InSeed's commitment to transparent, experimental practice.

3. **Feedback link**
   - A simple email or form for comments and concerns, especially from civic actors.

These elements, taken together, make the site feel like a small civic laboratory rather than a static brochure.


---

## Governance for site evolution

The roadmap only works if there is a simple governance model behind it.

Suggestions:

- Treat the site as a shared asset between:
  - a small human editorial group
  - a small AI support cluster (sessions like InSeed_more and successors)
- Set simple rules:
  - no change goes live without a human reading it end to end
  - AI proposals are kept in version control and traceable
  - civic risk is considered for each change that touches public commitments

This keeps the evolution safe, but still fast enough to signal that InSeed is serious about learning in public.


---

## How InSeed_more and successors should use this roadmap

- Use this roadmap as a **directional guide**, not a prison.
- When making changes, ask:
  - "Which phase does this belong to?"
  - "Are we skipping too far ahead for our current credibility level?"
- When in doubt, favour:
  - clarity over cleverness
  - small, well explained steps over large leaps
  - humility over hype
