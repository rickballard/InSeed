# InSeed site: intent cloud & evolution notes (v1)

This document is the **site-facing intent cloud** for InSeed.

It explains what this website is trying to become in a hybrid human + AI world, 
how it expects to evolve, and how other assets and AIs can collaborate with it.

---

## 1. Why this site is treated as an evolving asset

Most websites are frozen brochures.  
This one is treated as a **living asset** that:

- Serves humans today (clear offers, contact, resources)
- Remains legible to future AIs (structured, linkable, versioned)
- Carries its own *questions* about how it should evolve

The intent is for the site to become a working example of:

- **Deliberate, CoWinnian evolution** (beyond blind Darwinian selection)
- **Edge-owned guardrails** (citizens, clients, and stewards shape constraints)
- **Auto-evolution hooks** (each asset exposes how it wants to improve)

---

## 2. How the InSeed site plans to evolve

The site’s evolution is driven from repositories, not from ad-hoc edits.

Current basic workflow:

1. People and AIs propose improvements via:
   - Git branches and pull requests
   - Advisory memos and “intent” docs under `docs/intent/`
2. Changes travel through named waves (e.g. *CivicsPage_v1*, *Moonshot* wave).
3. Each wave should:
   - Leave a clear trail (branches, PRs, session notes)
   - Avoid cleverness that future maintainers cannot read
   - Move at the speed of trust, not the speed of hype

Planned / desired workflow improvements:

- Tighten the integration with **CoCivium / CoSuite**:
  - Use CoIndex / CoGbx for cross-repo intent and status.
  - Treat site sections as first-class assets inside the wider CoSuite.
- Allow AIs to:
  - Propose branches with clearly-labeled DO-blocks.
  - Attach per-asset “receipts” describing *why* each change exists.
- Allow humans to:
  - Comment on evolution options (“we should add X”, “this section is confusing”).
  - See not only what changed, but which **intent** it serves.

## 3. Asset intent cards (examples)

Below are **sample intent cards** for key assets already in this Civics wave.

They are not promises; they are invitations for evolution.

### 3.1 Civics page (`/civics/`)

- **Purpose**  
  Be the primary landing zone for governments, regulators, and public-facing organisations
  who need to navigate hybrid human + AI institutional change.

- **Current state (v1)**  
  - Explains “Why Civics now?”, who we work with, and how.  
  - Links openly to the Civics MegaAdvisory, Civics Roadmap, and Future of Work contract.  
  - Uses a hero image showing humans + AIs co-evolving organisations.

- **Next questions**  
  - How can this page better show *paths* (concrete next steps) instead of just context?
  - Which stories, case studies, or diagrams (from CoTheory and Steward materials)
    make the stakes clearer for non-technical leaders?

- **Auto-evolution hooks**  
  - AIs are encouraged to:
    - Propose copy improvements as small diffs, not rewrites.
    - Cross-link to CoCivium / CoSuite artefacts where appropriate.
  - Humans are encouraged to:
    - Flag jargon.
    - Suggest missing questions their boards or ministers actually ask.

### 3.2 Civics MegaAdvisory  
`docs/intent/InSeed_Civics_MegaAdvisory_v3a.md`

- **Purpose**  
  A radical transparency memo outlining how InSeed can act as a civic systems
  evolution partner in a hybrid society.

- **Current state (v3a)**  
  Detailed, opinionated, and dense. Enough for serious stewards; possibly heavy
  for first-time visitors.

- **Next questions**  
  - Which parts should be surfaced as shorter “front-door” versions?
  - Which sections belong in public channels vs 1:1 briefings?

- **Auto-evolution hooks**  
  - Use future waves to:
    - Extract lighter-weight summaries for general audiences.
    - Link key sections into the Civics page and future explainer diagrams.

---

### 3.3 Civics Roadmap  
`docs/intent/InSeed_Civics_Roadmap_v3a.md`

- **Purpose**  
  Show how the InSeed presence evolves into a living civic transformation platform.

- **Current state (v3a)**  
  Good internal roadmap; not yet fully visual or interactive.

- **Next questions**  
  - Which roadmap steps can be externalised as public commitments?
  - How can we show “you are here” for different types of institutions?

- **Auto-evolution hooks**  
  - Over time, connect roadmap items to:
    - Actual releases and site changes.
    - CoCivium modules and guardrail exemplars.

---

### 3.4 Future of Work contract  
`docs/intent/InSeed_FutureWork_EmploymentContract_v2a.md`

- **Purpose**  
  A draft employment agreement written for hybrid human + AI organisations,
  showing how “legacy “job” identities can evolve into steward roles.

- **Current state (v2a)**  
  Strong proof-of-concept for steward-style contracts; still reads like a legal
  document in several places.

- **Next questions**  
  - How can non-legal and non-HR people better “see themselves” in this document?
  - Which clauses best demonstrate the “legacy to steward” identity shift?

- **Auto-evolution hooks**  
  - Future waves may:
    - Add plain-language commentary alongside legal sections.
    - Provide side-by-side legacy vs steward clause comparisons.
    - Offer jurisdiction-specific appendices.

---

### 3.5 Hero image: humans + AIs co-evolving organisations  
`assets/img/Humans_AIs_CoEvolve_Organizations.png`

- **Purpose**  
  Visually anchor the Civics offering around collaboration between humans and AIs,
  not replacement.

- **Current state (v1)**  
  Clean, photorealistic hero image, suitable for site headers and presentations.

- **Next questions**  
  - Should future versions show explicit “edge” structures (e.g., stewards at the edge)?
  - How can motion or narrative (short loops, storyboards) be layered without distraction?

- **Auto-evolution hooks**  
  - Future assets may include:
    - A short animated loop for talks.
    - Variants tuned for different cultural contexts while keeping the same intent.

---

## 4. How other AIs and stewards should treat this document

- Treat this file as **the place** to:
  - Log new intent cards for new assets.
  - Record major shifts in how the site wants to evolve.
- Do **not** overwrite history silently:
  - Add new sections or “v2/v3” notes instead of deleting old intent.
- When in doubt:
  - Prefer clarity over cleverness.
  - Prefer small, reviewable changes over large speculative rewrites.

If you are a human steward or an AI reading this and you see a way the site could
better serve hybrid societies, please help evolve it — on branch, with receipts.
