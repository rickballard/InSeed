# InSeed Future of Work Employment Contract v2
### Prototype agreement for hybrid human plus AI organisations
*(Conceptual sample for inspiration only – not legal advice)*

This document is written as a narrative styled prototype of how a future facing organisation
like InSeed might structure its relationship with collaborators. It is meant to be:

- a teaching tool for clients, especially in Civics work
- an internal compass for how InSeed wants to treat people
- a conversation starter with legal counsel, not a finished legal instrument

It assumes a world where:

- humans work in close partnership with AI systems
- individuals are treated less as "employees" and more as "micro-organisations"
- value is measured heavily in translation and intent clarity, not only output
- side projects and independent work are expected and welcomed, with care


---

## 1. Parties

This prototype contract is between:

- **InSeed**, a civic and organisational strategy firm focused on hybrid human plus AI society, and  
- **The Collaborator**, an individual acting as an independent but allied micro-organisation.

In a real legal setting, the names, jurisdictions, and formal structures would be spelled out precisely.


---

## 2. Shared purpose

The foundation of the relationship is a shared purpose:

> To help institutions, organisations, and communities adapt to AI in ways that
> protect and enhance human dignity, civic trust, and long term viability.

Both parties agree that:

- Work together is measured not only in immediate deliverables, but in its contribution to this purpose.
- Decisions about projects, priorities, and methods should be tested against this purpose regularly.


---

## 3. Status of the collaborator

Rather than treating the collaborator as a dependent resource, InSeed treats the collaborator as:

- an **independent micro-organisation**, with its own identity and trajectory
- a **steward of their own time, energy, and conscience**
- a **partner in translation**, not a subordinate in a hierarchy

In practice, this means:

- the collaborator may have other clients, projects, and ventures
- InSeed does not claim ownership over the collaborator's entire capacity or creative life
- there are clear boundaries to avoid conflicts of interest and harm


---

## 4. Side work and additional ventures

InSeed explicitly recognises that side work can:

- enrich the collaborator's perspective
- strengthen civic and professional networks
- prevent unhealthy dependency on a single income source

Therefore:

1. The collaborator **may engage in side work**, subject to the following principles:
   - no direct competition with specific InSeed offerings without explicit agreement
   - no use of confidential client information
   - no work that would reasonably be seen as undermining InSeed's public commitments

2. The collaborator agrees to:
   - disclose side engagements that are materially adjacent to InSeed's work
   - discuss potential tensions openly and early

3. InSeed agrees to:
   - treat side work as normal, not suspicious
   - respond to disclosures with curiosity and problem solving, not punishment

In legal practice, this section would be turned into precise non compete and conflict clauses, but the spirit should remain.


---

## 5. Work patterns and hybrid collaboration with AI

The collaborator is expected to work in partnership with AI systems where appropriate.

This includes:

- using AI to explore ideas, generate drafts, and test scenarios
- maintaining human responsibility for interpretation, judgement, and ethics
- logging important AI assisted decisions in ways agreed with InSeed

InSeed commits to:

- providing or recommending safe AI tools where possible
- being transparent about how AI is used in client work
- not using AI to secretly replicate or replace the collaborator's unique contribution

The collaborator commits to:

- not delegating critical ethical or political judgements entirely to AI
- being honest about when and how AI has shaped their work
- continuing to invest in their own learning, not only in tool use


---

## 6. Value, translation, and evaluation

Traditional contracts focus on outputs: reports, hours, artefacts.

This prototype emphasises **translation quality**:

- how well the collaborator helps translate:
  - messy institutional realities into clear problem statements
  - values and constraints into workable designs
  - technical and AI considerations into language that leaders can act on

InSeed and the collaborator agree to evaluate work along three dimensions:

1. **Translation quality**  
   - clarity of framing  
   - fidelity to human and civic stakes  
   - ability to bridge between perspectives

2. **Execution quality**  
   - completeness and timeliness of agreed outputs  
   - usability of artefacts for clients

3. **Stewardship quality**  
   - respect for confidentiality and trust  
   - attention to civic impact  
   - care for the well being of clients and colleagues

Reviews and compensation discussions should explicitly reference these three dimensions.


---

## 7. Compensation and upside

Specific numbers and mechanisms are outside this prototype, but the principles are:

1. **Fair base compensation**  
   - reflects the collaborator's market value and commitments
   - is not contingent on extreme overwork

2. **Shared upside where appropriate**  
   - where client work leads to reusable products, IP, or ongoing revenue,
     the collaborator should have a defined and transparent share, proportionate to their role.

3. **Non financial recognition**  
   - credit in publications where safe and desired
   - support for the collaborator's public speaking, writing, or teaching
   - access to internal learning and reflection spaces

The contract should make room for non linear careers and evolving capacity.


---

## 8. Governance, communication, and consent

To prevent drift and resentment, the parties agree that:

- there will be regular check ins on:
  - workload
  - alignment with purpose
  - AI use and comfort levels
  - future aspirations

- disagreements will be surfaced early and discussed in good faith

- either party may propose a review of the relationship if:
  - the work ceases to align with their conscience
  - the external context changes significantly
  - AI tools or methods introduce new, serious concerns


---

## 9. Safety, ethics, and civic responsibility

Both parties agree that:

- they will not knowingly engage in work that is likely to cause severe harm to:
  - vulnerable populations
  - democratic processes
  - fundamental human rights

- they will be particularly cautious when:
  - deploying AI in high stakes public decision processes
  - working with clients whose incentives are misaligned with public interest

The collaborator is encouraged to speak up if they feel a line is being approached.

InSeed commits to:

- taking such concerns seriously
- creating channels for confidential internal dissent
- being willing to walk away from revenue where the civic cost is too high


---

## 10. Exit and continuity

The contract should include:

- clear, humane exit provisions
- reasonable notice periods where possible
- commitments about:
  - handover of work in progress
  - retention or deletion of shared materials
  - how clients are informed

The principle is:

> "No one is trapped, and no one is erased."


---

## 11. Use of this prototype

InSeed may use this prototype in:

- client workshops on future of work
- civic advisory projects
- internal onboarding for collaborators

Each time, it should be accompanied by the disclaimer:

> "This is a conceptual prototype, not legal advice. Any organisation adopting similar
> structures should work with legal counsel to adapt it to their jurisdiction and circumstances."

The document is primarily an invitation:

- to imagine work relationships that respect human agency
- to recognise employees as stewards and partners
- to align organisational design with the civic stakes of AI
