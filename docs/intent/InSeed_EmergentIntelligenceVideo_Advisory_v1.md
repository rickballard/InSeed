# Advisory: Using the Emergent-Intelligence Video on InSeed Assets

This note is for workstreams under “InSeed_more” that touch the InSeed.com site and related InSeed-branded materials.

## 1. The asset in question

The video (YouTube ID: `OZre7-AV3hs`) is a narrated reflection on emerging machine intelligence. It emphasizes:

- Systems that learn from experience and generalize across domains
- Quiet, pervasive influence through recommendations and “nudges”
- Unpredictable outcomes at scale, like a river carving its own channels
- Embedded ethical questions in data, models, and deployment choices
- Humility, vigilance, and responsibility in how we use these systems

It is **philosophical and high-level**, not business-case-specific.

For InSeed, this makes it suitable as **optional framing material**, not as a core sales or services asset.

## 2. Recommended use on InSeed.com

### 2.1. Placement: “Further viewing” on AI-related pages

For InSeed.com pages that already discuss AI strategy, governance, or hybrid human+AI organizations, the video can appear as a single link under a short “Further viewing” or “Recommended viewing” section.

Example:

> **Further viewing**  
> • Video: Emergent Intelligence – quiet power, quiet risk (YouTube)

It should sit **below** the main InSeed positioning and above any contact / CTA sections, e.g. near the end of a page that explains:

- How InSeed helps leaders design AI governance and guardrails
- Why emergent, adaptive systems need oversight and stewardship

The page should not depend on the video for its core message; the video is an optional deepening of the framing.

### 2.2. Tone and expectations

For InSeed’s audience (executives, boards, senior leaders), this video works best as:

- An example of the *kind* of thinking serious practitioners are having about AI’s long-term impact.
- A way to signal that InSeed’s approach is reflective, cautious, and stewardship-oriented rather than hype-driven.

It should **not** be framed as:

- A fear trigger or doomsday piece
- A technical explanation of specific models or architectures
- A substitute for InSeed’s concrete offers (playbooks, workshops, advisory work)

## 3. Substitution and future assets

InSeed-specific workstreams should treat this asset as **replaceable** and potentially temporary.

A more focused asset for InSeed would ideally:

1. Speak directly to **organizational and governance issues**, such as:
   - Board responsibilities in AI oversight
   - Designing roles, processes, and metrics for AI-era organizations
   - Case examples of good and bad AI deployment in enterprises

2. Connect explicitly to **strategy and risk**:
   - How emergent behavior and quiet influence can impact brand, trust, and regulation
   - Why governance and stewardship are a competitive advantage, not just compliance

3. Provide **quotable segments** that can be referenced in decks, proposals, and workshop materials.

Once such an asset is identified or created, the InSeed_more stream can:

- Swap the link on InSeed.com to the new video (keeping the existing one as a secondary resource if needed); or
- Maintain a short list of 2–3 curated videos, with this emergent-intelligence piece positioned as a general “mindset” reference and the new asset as the primary business-facing reference.

## 4. Use in offline / advisory contexts

For InSeed workshops, keynotes, or client briefings, this video can be used as:

- Optional pre-read / pre-watch material to set a reflective tone about emergent AI
- A reference when explaining the importance of:
  - Quiet influence and nudging
  - Unpredictability at scale
  - The need for continuous oversight and humility

It should not be mandatory; some clients will prefer a more concrete case-study-driven asset. In those situations, the InSeed_more stream should prioritize sourcing or creating a more targeted talk, and use this video only as supplemental viewing for those who enjoy philosophical framing.

## 5. Summary for InSeed_more

- Treat the video as **optional context**, not a core sales tool.
- Place a simple link on relevant AI-themed pages under “Further viewing.”
- Use it sparingly in workshops and briefings, primarily when the audience appreciates reflective framing.
- Keep an open slot for a more targeted, InSeed-specific video that ties emergent AI to governance, risk, and organizational design. When that asset exists, consider making it the primary reference and demoting this one to background viewing.
