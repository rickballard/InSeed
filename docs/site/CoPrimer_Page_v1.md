# InSeed CoPrimer Page v1 (skeleton)

Role: Exec-facing primer page for AI-driven seismic change and InSeed's role.

## 1. Opening (the shock)

- Yes, your job function is at risk.
- AI is changing the ground under you faster than your org can restructure.
- You can either:
  - let the ground collapse, or
  - build a stronger home on top of it.

## 2. Reframing (the opportunity)

- InSeed exists to help executives:
  - see the real shape of the risk,
  - design experiments instead of defenses,
  - co-evolve with AI instead of competing with it.

## 3. What we do (very briefly)

- Bullet list of core InSeed offerings.
- Tie each to CoCivium ideas (edge control, CoStewardship, CoPortals) in exec language.

## 4. Call to action

- Simple, clear invitation:
  - book a conversation,
  - review a short deck (Dino),
  - read the whitepaper if they want depth.

Next steps:
- Refine tone to match InSeed brand.
- Wire this page into the actual site structure.
