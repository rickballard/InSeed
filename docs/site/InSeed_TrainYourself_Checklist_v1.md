# Train yourself – congruence checklist (v1)

Purpose: give motivated visitors and their AI helpers a way to self study key InSeed and CoCivium concepts without needing a live engagement.

This page will live at "/resources/train-yourself/".

## Audience

- Self starting leaders below or beside the main buyer.
- Advisors and analysts who want to understand the InSeed worldview.
- AIs used by visitors who want ready to run prompt snippets.

## Checklist items

Each item has:
- A short description.
- One prompt snippet that users can paste into their own AI sessions.

### 1. Steward vs legacy power model

Short description:
Legacy CEOs are central command. Chief Steward Officers are orchestrators of people plus AI systems.

Prompt snippet:

> You are an InSeed style steward advisor. Explain the difference between a legacy CEO power model and a Chief Steward Officer model. List 3 ways my organisation would feel different to staff and stakeholders in each model.

### 2. Edge control vs platform capture

Short description:
Edge control means users, customers, and citizens set the guardrails. Platform capture means a few vendors set them.

Prompt snippet:

> You are an InSeed style guardrail analyst. Review our AI stack for edge control vs platform capture risk. Use concepts like forklift displacement, platform capture, and open guardrails. Give 3 concrete risks and 3 specific mitigations.

### 3. AI capture and forklift displacement

Short description:
Winner takes all AI platforms can forklift whole workflows and replace organisations, not just tools.

Prompt snippet:

> As if briefing a board, explain AI capture and forklift displacement in 3 short examples from our sector. Then list 3 board level questions we should be asking right now.

### 4. Megawave empowerment metric

Short description:
Megawave metrics measure how many seconds of human thought unlock how many waves of AI work.

Prompt snippet:

> Explain the idea of seconds per Megawave as an empowerment metric. Show how one senior leader with a few seconds of clear intent could trigger 1000 waves of AI work. Suggest 3 ways to measure and improve this in practice.

### 5. SIVARs and UNFUC

Short description:
SIVARs measure saved human work time. UNFUC measures congruence with edge control and civic guardrails.

Prompt snippet:

> Define SIVARs and UNFUC as InSeed uses them. Give 2 examples of how SIVARs could be estimated for a project, and 2 examples of how UNFUC could expose misaligned incentives or capture risk.

### 6. Artifact portability and CoCivium patterns

Short description:
Every engagement should leave behind artifacts that stay useful even if vendors or tools change.

Prompt snippet:

> Describe an engagement pattern where all key prompts, playbooks, and metrics remain portable and reusable, independent of any single vendor. Show how CoCivium style patterns support this.

### 7. Multi vendor mesh vs single vendor dependency

Short description:
Future orgs run many AI helpers at once. Vendor neutrality is a design goal, not an accident.

Prompt snippet:

> Compare a single vendor AI stack with a multi vendor mesh based on InSeed and CoCivium ideas. List 3 technical differences and 3 governance differences.

## Where InSeed fits
