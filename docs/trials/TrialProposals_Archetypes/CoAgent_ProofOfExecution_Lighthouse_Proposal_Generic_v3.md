# CoAgent Proof of Execution "Lighthouse Trial"
## Generic draft for large professional services organisations

Target archetype: Ms T – senior transformation or transitions leader in a large professional services partnership, with responsibility for change portfolios and talent movements.

### 1. Context

Large partnership organisations face pressures from:

- automation of knowledge work by AI
- client demand for greater transparency and speed
- emerging AI mediated roles for partners, managers and CEOs

Many organisations run isolated AI experiments. Few have a coherent, auditable way to bring AI into critical internal workflows such as role transitions, project mobilisation or portfolio governance.

CoAgent is an AI orchestrated workflow layer designed for exactly these situations:

- it coordinates AI models, tools and human decisions into repeatable processes
- it provides a simple, human readable audit trail for leadership

CoAgent is part of a broader open civic tech initiative called CoCivium and its CoSuite of tools. CoCivium focuses on hybrid human and AI systems with edge owned guardrails and simple principles such as "no crowns, no coercion, no corruption". The aim is to support decisions that remain visible, explainable and answerable to people at the edge of the system, not only to central platforms or narrow leadership circles.

A Lighthouse Trial offers a safe, time boxed way to explore these ideas in a small corner of the organisation, grounded in a concrete transitions or change routine.

### 2. Objectives

The Lighthouse focuses on one or two internal workflows, such as a transition office routine or a recurring change programme ritual, with four main objectives:

1. execution quality
2. visibility and fairness
3. learning and future pivots
4. safe experimentation without system disruption

More broadly, it gives leadership a practical way to test what steward like AI use could look like inside the organisation, aligned with the guardrail thinking behind CoCivium.

### 3. Scope and design

Duration: typically 6 to 8 weeks

Workflows: one or two defined processes, such as:

- role transitions for a specific population
- a monthly or quarterly change programme ritual

Approach:

1. discover
   - map steps, roles, tools, artefacts and pain points in the current workflow
2. configure
   - implement a CoAgent workflow that pulls relevant information together, prompts useful questions at the right time and records key rationales in human readable form
3. run in parallel
   - run CoAgent alongside the existing routine for an agreed period
4. compare and learn
   - evaluate on speed, quality, perceived fairness and leadership insight

### 4. Guardrails

To protect both people and the organisation, and to stay aligned with CoCivium style ethics, the Lighthouse uses simple guardrails:

- human in control
- data boundaries defined up front
- no surveillance
- reversible without disruption

These guardrails mirror CoCivium’s broader concern with trust, answerability and non coercive uses of AI in civic and organisational settings.

### 5. Service ladder

The Lighthouse can stand alone, or sit within a broader modular path:

1. CoAudit diagnostic
2. CoAgent Lighthouse Trial
3. centre of excellence and executive retrain seminars
4. optional industry stewardship council

This ladder lets organisations start small, then choose whether to participate in a wider conversation about how AI and human decision makers share work in the profession, echoing the civic scale questions that CoCivium tackles.

### 6. Optional multi organisation approach

Each organisation runs its Lighthouse internally.

CoAgent and InSeed can combine anonymised meta learning around:

- governance
- talent impacts
- process design
- AI mediated leadership flows

Organisations may join a small stewardship council to compare lessons safely.

Over time, this can feed into shared reference models for responsible AI use in partnerships, aligned with CoCivium’s aim of helping institutions move toward transparent, steward led forms of hybrid human and AI governance.

### 7. Commercial model (illustrative only)

The Lighthouse is structured as a fixed scope engagement that normally covers:

- workflow mapping
- CoAgent configuration for one or two workflows
- support during the trial period
- a final synthesis and recommendations workshop

For early prototype partners, InSeed is prepared to be flexible on fees, including the possibility of substantial or full discounts, in exchange for:

- a serious internal sponsor
- access to qualitative feedback from participants and leaders
- the option to reference the Lighthouse, anonymised or named, as agreed, in future materials

This is a generic concept draft, not a commercial offer to any specific organisation. Concrete terms and pricing would be agreed directly with the relevant leadership.

The underlying intent is to give organisations a practical first step into AI supported, people accountable workflows, while contributing to the broader CoCivium goal of building trustworthy, human aligned hybrid systems.
