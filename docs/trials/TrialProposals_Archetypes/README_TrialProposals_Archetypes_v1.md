# Trial proposal archetypes pack

This folder contains generic, on repo safe templates for trial proposals and related materials.

Archetypes:

- Ms T – senior transformation or transitions leader in a large professional services partnership
- Ms P – professor or teaching stream academic working on visual literacy, identity, civic or public space

Files:

- Email_Template_MsT_TransformationExec_v1.txt
- Email_Template_MsP_ProfessorCivicLiteracy_v1.txt
- CoAgent_ProofOfExecution_Lighthouse_Overview_Generic_v3.md
- CoAgent_ProofOfExecution_Lighthouse_Proposal_Generic_v3.md
- README_TrialProposals_Archetypes_v1.md

These are intended to be copied or adapted into repos such as InSeed, CoSteward or CoAgent under paths like:

- docs/trials/
- docs/intent/trials/
- docs/offers/lighthouse/

When adapting for a real target, replace the placeholders (for example [ExecName], [FirmName]) in the email templates, but keep the generic on repo versions clean and archetype based.
