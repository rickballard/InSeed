# CoAgent Proof of Execution "Lighthouse Trial"
## Low friction trial for transitions and transformation teams

Target archetype: Ms T – senior leader responsible for transformation, transitions or business change in a large professional services partnership or similar organisation.

### 1. Why run a Lighthouse

The CoAgent Lighthouse is a short, contained trial that lets an organisation see how an AI orchestrated workflow layer can support real transition and transformation work, without asking anyone to change systems or take a leap of faith.

The practical goals are to:

- increase consistency and throughput for key routines such as role transitions or portfolio rituals
- improve visibility and perceived fairness around those routines
- give leadership a clearer view of how AI mediated workflows might change the way the organisation operates

CoAgent is not another chat window. It sits behind the scenes, coordinating tools, data and human steps into a repeatable, auditable process.

CoAgent also sits inside a wider open civic tech effort called CoCivium and its CoSuite of tools. CoCivium focuses on hybrid human and AI systems with simple principles such as "no crowns, no coercion, no corruption" and edge owned guardrails. In practical terms, that means aiming for workflows where AI support is visible, explainable and answerable to the people who live with the consequences, not only to platforms or central owners.

The Lighthouse is a small, local way to explore those ideas using a concrete transitions or change routine as the test bed.

### 2. Who this is for

- transition offices and PMOs
- transformation leaders and centres of excellence
- strategy and change teams who run repeatable processes with many documents, meetings and follow ups

The Lighthouse assumes the organisation already has people, tools and rhythms in place. CoAgent wraps around them rather than replacing them.

### 3. What we focus on

We choose one or two concrete workflows. For example:

- preparing, approving and communicating a role transition for a defined population
- a recurring change programme status ritual such as monthly or quarterly synthesis and briefing

For each workflow we:

1. map steps, people, tools, artefacts and pain points
2. configure a CoAgent workflow that orchestrates
   - AI steps such as drafting, triage, summarisation and pattern spotting
   - human steps such as approvals and conversations
   - system touchpoints such as files, calendars and tickets
3. run the CoAgent workflow in parallel with the existing one
4. compare outcomes on speed, quality and perceived fairness

### 4. Guardrails

To keep the trial safe and aligned with CoCivium style ethics, the Lighthouse uses simple guardrails:

- human in control. CoAgent does not approve moves or make final decisions
- data boundaries agreed up front. Only data needed for the chosen workflows is brought into scope
- no surveillance. The goal is to improve the process, not judge individuals
- reversible at any time. The organisation can switch the CoAgent workflow off and continue as before

### 5. Typical timeline

- week 0: scoping and workflow selection
- week 1 to 2: mapping and configuration
- week 3 to 6: live trial
- week 7 to 8: debrief and next step recommendations

### 6. What the organisation receives

At the end of the Lighthouse, the organisation receives:

- a clear description of the chosen workflows as implemented in CoAgent
- simple metrics and qualitative feedback from participants and leaders
- lessons around governance, data boundaries and perceived fairness
- a recommendation to extend, pause or park the approach

Early prototype partners may receive flexible pricing so the Lighthouse can be treated primarily as a learning exercise.

In parallel, leadership gains an early view of how open, human accountable AI systems like CoCivium and InSeed’s CoSuite might influence expectations around transparency, shared decision making and the future role of leadership in AI mediated organisations.
