# Moonshot EN/FR Headers and CTAs v1

Repo-suggested path:
`InSeed/docs/moonshot/site/Moonshot_ENFR_Headers_v1.md`

This asset provides bilingual (EN/FR) hero text and primary CTAs for the Moonshot page. It is not a full translation, but a starter kit focused on:

- the main hero headline,
- the supporting subheadline,
- the primary and secondary call-to-action buttons.

It is written to be Canadian-federal friendly, with language that can be further refined by a professional translator if needed.

## 1. Hero headline

**English (EN)**  
> A safer, faster way to adopt AI in government

**French (FR, draft)**  
> Une façon plus sûre et plus rapide d’adopter l’IA au sein du gouvernement

Notes:
- "au sein du gouvernement" is meant to sound natural and institutionally neutral.
- This is a working translation that can be refined with official translation support.

## 2. Hero subheadline

**English (EN)**  
> Stress-tested in commercial environments. Refined for public institutions.

**French (FR, draft)**  
> Éprouvé dans le secteur privé. Adapté et affiné pour les institutions publiques.

Notes:
- "Éprouvé" communicates the idea of being tested under pressure, which fits the intent.
- "Adapté et affiné" indicates both adaptation and refinement for public institutions.

## 3. Primary call-to-action button

**English (EN)**  
Label:  
> Explore a pilot

**French (FR, draft)**  
Label:  
> Explorer un projet pilote

Notes:
- "projet pilote" is standard federal wording in many contexts.

---

## 4. Secondary call-to-action button

**English (EN)**  
Label:  
> Guardrail diagnostic

**French (FR, draft)**  
Label:  
> Diagnostic des garde-fous

Notes:
- "garde-fous" is commonly used in French for guardrails in policy contexts.
- Co1 and translators may decide to standardize this term across all guardrail-facing assets.

## 5. Usage notes

1. These strings should be treated as centralized copy, not repeated literal strings spread across templates.
2. The site templates should reference these from a single source (for example via partials or a copy registry) to keep future changes simple.
3. For any federal or public-facing deployment, these lines should be reviewed by a fluent French speaker with government or policy translation experience.
4. Once validated, GIBindex entries can be created for:
   - Moonshot hero EN v1
   - Moonshot hero FR v1
   - Moonshot CTA EN v1
   - Moonshot CTA FR v1

These entries then become canonical references for future CoPortals and AI-facing interfaces.
