## 1. Hero Section (Top of Page)

**Purpose:** Immediate clarity for federal decision-makers.

**Layout:**
- Full-width hero band.
- Left: headline + subheadline + 1–2 bullet lines.
- Right: optional illustration / abstract graphic (non-cheesy, trust-focused).

**Content hooks:**
- H1: “A safer, faster way to adopt AI in government”
- Subheadline: “Stress-tested in commercial environments. Refined for public institutions.”
- CTA buttons:
  - Primary: “Explore a pilot”
  - Secondary: “Guardrail diagnostic”

**Notes:**
- Visual tone: serious but optimistic, not hypey.
- Works well on desktop and mobile.

---

## 2. Why This Matters (Context Band)

**Purpose:** Show urgency + relevance without fear-mongering.

**Layout:**
- Single-column or two-column text block.
- Short paragraphs + 3–4 bullets.

**Content hooks:**
- Emphasize:
  - AI inevitability vs. trustworthy AI as a choice.
  - Public trust as core institutional asset.
  - Risk of moving too quickly without guardrails.
  - Risk of moving too slowly and losing capability.

**Notes:**
- This band connects Moonshot to high-level public-service missions.

---

## 3. What Moonshot Provides (Core Offer Band)

**Purpose:** Explain what Moonshot is in practical terms.

**Layout:**
- Three or four feature cards.
- Icons/graphics per card (simple, line-style).

**Cards:**
1. Guardrail Frameworks
2. Civic-Safe AI Enablement
3. Transparency & Trust-by-Design
4. Commercial-Stress-Tested Patterns (optional separate card)

**Notes:**
- Each card links to deeper documentation where appropriate.
- Focus on clarity over marketing fluff.

---

## 4. Who It’s For (Audience Band)

**Purpose:** Allow visitors to self-recognize quickly.

**Layout:**
- Short intro line.
- Bulleted role list, or tiles grouped by category.

**Audience examples:**
- AI governance units
- Digital / data governance councils
- Digital modernization programs
- Ministry-level AI enablement teams

**Notes:**
- Each role category may eventually link to a tailored subpage.

---

## 5. How a Pilot Works (Process Band)

**Purpose:** Reduce fear and uncertainty about engagement.

**Layout:**
- Horizontal 4–5 step process bar (Discovery → Design → Build → Evaluate → Scale/Sunset).

**Content hooks:**
- Emphasize low-risk, reversible steps.
- Stress transparency at each stage.
- Highlight auditability and oversight.

**Notes:**
- Should feel like a controlled, safe, well-lit path.

---

## 6. What Makes Moonshot Different (Differentiators Band)

**Purpose:** Distinguish from generic AI vendors.

**Layout:**
- Two-column text or a grid of 3–4 bullet clusters.

**Core differentiators:**
- Guardrails-first, not tool-first.
- Transparency as design principle.
- Repo-first, version-controlled workflows.
- Hybrid human–AI design.

**Notes:**
- This is where CoCivium values show through most clearly.

---

## 7. Call-to-Action Band (Lower CTA)

**Purpose:** Give a second, calmer ask.

**Layout:**
- Simple banner with:
  - One main line.
  - One supporting line.
  - One primary CTA button.

**Examples:**
- “Talk to us about a low-risk AI pilot.”
- Button: “Book an exploration call”.

**Notes:**
- This section should be visually distinct but not jarring.

---

## 8. Footer + Transparency Link

**Purpose:** Close with trust and openness.

**Layout:**
- Normal site footer (nav, legal, contact).
- Additional line:

  > “How this page was designed (transparency)”

  linked to `Moonshot_TransparencyFooter_v1.md` or the rendered page equivalent.

**Notes:**
- This footer link is a key CoCivium-aligned signature.

---

## 9. Responsive Behaviour Notes

- On mobile:
  - Hero should stack (headline above CTA, then image).
  - Cards become vertical.
  - Process steps may scroll horizontally or stack vertically.
- Typography:
  - Clean, legible sans-serif.
  - Avoid ultra-light weights for primary text.

---

## 10. Future Extensions (v2+)

- Role-specific variants (e.g., dedicated pages for AI governance, digital modernization).  
- Bilingual EN/FR header and CTA variants for Canadian federal readiness.  
- Integration with CoGibber/GBX metadata for AI-facing navigation.  
- Embedded short video or interactive guardrail diagram.
