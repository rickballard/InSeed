# Moonshot Target Profile Grid v1  
For InSeed → Canadian Federal Government Positioning  
Repo-suggested path:  
`InSeed/docs/moonshot/strategy/Moonshot_TargetProfileGrid_v1.md`

This grid summarizes **who** the initial Moonshot page is optimized for and **what** they care about.

## Category A1 — AI Governance Units
### Needs

- Strong public accountability narratives  

### Concerns
- Political risk  
- Public criticism if AI goes wrong  
- Fear of “black box” systems  
- Procurement defensibility  
- Interdepartmental resistance  
- Privacy & data governance  
- Vendor reliability  

### Leverageables
- CoCivium = transparency-first  
- InSeed = commercially battle-tested before civic deployment  
- MegaWave = audit-friendly artifact trail  
- Repo-first = verifiable history  
- Edge-control = democratic comfort (“no hidden backend”)  
- GIBindex = structured concept clarity

- Need for vendor consistency  
- Fear of unintentionally breaking things  

### Leverageables
- InSeed’s commercial-speed stress testing  
- Moonshot → clear deliverables + simple adoption  
- MegaWave → reproducible implementation waves  
- CoAgent/CoArena → internal tooling for staff  
- Repo-first → lower integration overhead

This grid is meant to be **reused** whenever we build:
- new Moonshot versions,
- ministry-specific variants,
- or briefing packs for federal stakeholders.
