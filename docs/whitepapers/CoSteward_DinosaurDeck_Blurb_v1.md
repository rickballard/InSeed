### For Dinosaurs Only: The Legacy Exec Training Deck

This slide deck is not how future forward leaders work.
It is how they used to work.

We built this "Dinosaur Edition" deck for three reasons:

1. To give legacy executives something familiar to click: a static slide deck.
2. To hold up a slightly uncomfortable mirror using Serious Mode and Snark Mode on every slide.
3. To smuggle in the same concepts you will meet in the CoSteward whitepaper, but in a format the old world still recognises.

Use this deck if:
- you are still stuck in slide culture;
- you want to laugh at the parts of yourself that are not steward ready yet;
- you need a low friction on ramp to the idea of becoming a Chief Steward Officer.

Do **not** use this deck as your final state.
It is a launchpad, not a destination.

The real upgrade lives in the CoSteward Hybrid Society whitepaper and the practices that follow.
