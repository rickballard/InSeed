<h1>CoFlow (delivery oversight & sourcing) — sample engagement brief</h1>
<div class="notice"><p>Client work is confidential. These briefs are composites: anonymized, data-stripped, and generalized so the approach is relevant across industries.</p></div>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Enterprise opted to keep delivery with vendors. The board asked for independent oversight that prevents single-AI bias and vendor lock-in while keeping strategy congruent with implementation.</p>
<h2>What InSeed did</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed RFP briefs and sourcing strategy with multi-vendor lanes and exit ramps.</li>
  <li>Built an evaluation matrix aligned to guardrails, data provenance, and interoperability.</li>
  <li>Benchmarked proposals against global best practice. Ran evidence reviews every week.</li>
  <li>Prototyped target workflows, policies, and controls. Updated SOPs and training plans.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
  <li>RFP briefs and vendor evaluation matrix. Decision log and architecture notes.</li>
  <li>Risk and compliance checks: leakage, lock-in, red-team, and audit trail.</li>
  <li>Scoreboard updates with shipped evidence from vendors. Go/hold recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Timeline & team</h2>
<p>12-week cadence. One InSeed lead as advisor, plus client owners. Vendor teams deliver; InSeed monitors evidence and alignment.</p>
