<h1>CoAudit — sample engagement brief</h1>
<div class="notice"><p>Client work is confidential. These briefs are composites: anonymized, data-stripped, and generalized so the approach is relevant across industries.</p></div>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Large enterprise preparing a pivot into an AI-enabled marketplace. Leadership wanted a fast scan of processes, risks, and opportunity to build a 30-60-90 plan with a visible scoreboard.</p>
<h2>What InSeed did</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mapped priority workflows and systems. Captured guardrails for data, compliance, and brand.</li>
  <li>Identified 3–5 bet lines with measurable outcomes and owners.</li>
  <li>Established the 30-60-90 scoreboard and evidence cadence. Set principles, constraints, and red lines.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Scoreboard: outcomes, metrics, owners, weekly evidence plan.</li>
  <li>Risk register: leakage, vendor lock-in, model drift, and mitigations.</li>
  <li>On-ramp plan: enablement, SOP updates, comms, and change map.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Timeline & team</h2>
<p>Week 0. One InSeed lead plus 2–3 stakeholders per function for interviews and evidence gathering.</p>
