# InSeed Polish Autopilot Kit

Zero‑touch helpers to wire a hero image, harden READMEs, maintain an assets manifest,
surface BPOE status, and keep things self‑evolving with scheduled, idempotent updates.

> **Defaults:** PowerShell 7+, GitHub Actions enabled. Safe by default — any auto‑commits are gated by a repo variable `ENABLE_AUTOCOMMITS=true`.

## Components
- **scripts/Apply-InSeed-Polish.ps1** — One‑shot wiring: hero banner, README sections, badges, PR template.
- **scripts/Ensure-Assets-Manifest.ps1** — Scans repo for assets → `docs/assets/manifest.(json|md)` + alt‑text stubs.
- **scripts/Ensure-Block.ps1** — Idempotent doc‑block writer (safe insert/replace by anchors).
- **scripts/AutoBadge-Status.ps1** — Emits README badge block (build, links, smoke).
- **tools/Repo-Smoke.ps1** — Fast local smoke: links, images, 404s (no net fetch for external links by default).
- **.github/workflows/readme-smoke.yml** — CI smoke on push/PR + nightly schedule.
- **.github/workflows/safety-gate.yml** — “Do no harm” gate: large‑diff guard, binary leaks, secret scan (lightweight).
- **.github/workflows/self-evolve.yml** — Nightly self‑maintenance: manifests, badges, SESSION_STATUS; optionally commits.
- **.github/pull_request_template.md** — Strict checklist incl. hero wired, ODT merge done, smoke passing.
- **docs/bpoe/SESSION_STATUS.md** — Autogenerated heartbeat/status (kept fresh by `self-evolve.yml`).

## Minimal Usage (one command)
```pwsh
# Example: run in the root of a repo (or pass -Repo path)
pwsh -File scripts/Apply-InSeed-Polish.ps1 -Repo . -Hero 'assets/InSeed_Hero.png' -OdtText '' -Force
```
If the hero image exists it’s wired into README. ODT text block is optional and can be pasted in later.

## Safe Autocommits
- Workflows will **not** push unless repo variable `ENABLE_AUTOCOMMITS=true` is set.
- If enabled, commits are signed by `github-actions[bot]` with message prefix `auto:`.
