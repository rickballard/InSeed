          Helping governments, regulators, and public-facing organisations evolve in a hybrid human + AI world.
        </p>
        <p>
          InSeed works with leaders who feel the ground shifting under their institutions:
          AI is changing not only tools, but the very shape of obligations to citizens,
          employees, and future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you work in government or public institutions, this is likely the most relevant
          place to start.

      <h2>Why Civics now?</h2>
      <p>
        Most “AI transformation” programmes start from tools and automation.
        InSeed starts from civic obligations: what it means to be a steward of
        public trust when intelligence is no longer only human.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protecting the integrity of democratic and civic institutions</li>
        <li>Making AI-enabled services legible and accountable to citizens</li>
        <li>Designing guardrails that are owned at the edge, not just in the platform</li>
        <li>Creating space for experimentation without sacrificing trust</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="who-we-help" class="section">
      <h2>Who we work with</h2>
      <p>
        InSeed’s Civics work is designed for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Senior civil servants and public sector executives</li>
        <li>Regulators and policy teams facing AI-driven change</li>
        <li>Large enterprises with significant civic and regulatory exposure</li>
        <li>Civic innovators, foundations, and coalitions building new models</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="how-we-work" class="section">
      <h2>How we work</h2>
      <p>
        We do not start from templates or pre-baked answers. We start from your
        actual institutions, people, and constraints, and we work forward with you
        in a series of design waves.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Short, high-signal advisory sprints with leadership teams</li>
        <li>Joint design of guardrails, governance, and operating principles</li>
        <li>Roadmaps for “legacy to steward” transformations</li>
        <li>Optional collaboration with the open-source CoCivium ecosystem</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our incentives are transparent. InSeed exists to accelerate healthy
        evolution of civic and economic systems, not to maximise billable hours.
