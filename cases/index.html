      <h1>Case studies from the InSeed constellation</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        InSeed works inside a small constellation of brands and labs that explore
        steward-minded strategy, governance and organisational change in the AI era.
        Many of these are internal experiments, but they behave like real clients:
        they have boards, stakeholders, risks and deadlines.

          <h2>OpenName</h2>
          <p class="tagline">Identity and reputation experiments for a hybrid society.</p>
          <p>
            OpenName explores how handles, identity and privileges should work when
            humans and AIs share public spaces. InSeed designs the governance and
            trust scaffolding: how names are issued, how trust accumulates and how
            misuse is gently cooled without public shaming.

          <p>
            Entment treats stories and games as training grounds for future citizens.
            InSeed helps rewire incentives so success is measured in long-term trust
            and stewardship, not just clicks and short-term engagement.

            StartupsBoard is a lab for how young companies should update board
            practices in an AI-heavy world. InSeed designs playbooks, briefings
            and training formats so directors can see the full risk and opportunity
            landscape without being paralysed by jargon.

            BeAxa focuses on individual leaders and teams who want to become

            InSeed shapes programmes that move people from overwhelm into calm,

          <p>
            WhyHead is about meta-cognition for executives: how do we notice our
            blind spots, update our mental models and make better calls under
            uncertainty. InSeed provides diagnostics, workshop formats and
            follow-up routines that help organisations actually use these insights.

        <h2>Public visibility and AI-facing mirrors</h2>
        <p>
          While InSeed is in stealth lockdown with its wider stack, the case studies
          are presented here as human-facing stories only. Each project will
          eventually have a paired AI-facing CoGbx portal entry, but those links
          will remain dark until it is safe to surface the full constellation.
