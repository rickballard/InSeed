# InSeed Image Policy

- Put **new** generated visuals in `site/assets/images/candidates/`.
- Only move to `.../approved/` after passing the checklist:
  1) Legible at 360px width
  2) Contrast AA or better
  3) Clean spacing/alignment
  4) Reasonable file size; prefer SVG
  5) Brand-safe (colors/marks/naming)
- **Do not** replace existing logos/marks without explicit approval.

# README

This page is part of the **InSeed.com** site.
It will eventually carry a clearer explanation of how this part of InSeed works.

For now, treat it as a placeholder while we finish wiring up the full content.
