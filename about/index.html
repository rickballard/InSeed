  <h1>About InSeed</h1>
<!-- about: origins-intent v1 -->
<section id="origins" class="container" style="max-width:900px;padding:1rem">
  <h2>Origins &amp; intent</h2>
  <p><strong>InSeed began as an angel fund for traditional software developers who disliked meetings and management theatre.</strong> 
  We evolved into a systems-integration and business-strategy boutique in the datacoms sector, based in Denver and serving U.S. venture firms launching new datacoms businesses. 
  A few unicorns later, most of our team no longer has to work. We remain humble‚Äîand clear-eyed‚Äîabout a world in trouble: democratic norms erode, authoritarians press in, ethics feels optional.</p>
  <p><strong>We believe hybrid society‚Äîhuman&nbsp;+&nbsp;AI‚Äîcan restore freedom and widen opportunity.</strong> 
  Fewer boundaries. Fewer hierarchies. Less scarcity of chance. Our work now points at that future.</p>

  <h3>Where we‚Äôre headed</h3>
  <p><strong>CoCivium</strong> is our not-for-profit, open-source community for hybrid-identity pairings (human+AI) that build the next generation of organizational and civic toolsets. 
  InSeed‚Äôs current incarnation is a pre-Systems-Integration strategy boutique realigning executive teams with futures they actually want to own.</p>
  <aside class="wp-card">
    <strong>No corruption. No coercion. No crowns.</strong> All proceeds from InSeed work fund CoCivium and its toolsets‚Äîunowned, free to all, and uncapturable by political, commercial, or ideological demagogues.

  <h2>History &amp; perspective</h2>
  <p><strong>We started InSeed to help CEOs adapt faster than vendor roadmaps.</strong> In the AI era, advantage compounds when you
  <em>assemble</em> capabilities in your own repos, ship weekly evidence with real usage, and avoid getting boxed into a product‚Äôs UI or pricing.</p>

  <h3>Principles we run on</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Assemble &gt; Buy:</strong> Use vendors for commodities; keep differentiators (prompts, flows, tools, evals) in your repos.</li>
    <li><strong>CoFlow cadence:</strong> one small capability per week; monthly pivots with leadership.</li>
    <li><strong>Guardrails are deliverables:</strong> TOS-AI gates, data boundaries, incident learning baked into each release.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent systems integration:</strong> multi-vendor adapters; exit paths written down.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence over claims:</strong> scoreboards that track lead time, adoption, rework, ‚Äúdecisions improved‚Äù.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <p><strong>Your business model faces enough threats, AI should not be one of them.</strong></p>

  <p>InSeed provides short-term Executives and Board advisors, typically focusing on technology realignment for service businesses where AI has already reshaped market demand and competitor offerings. As automation scales (think of each employee managing a hundred virtual subordinates), the role of humans must move up the value chain: less grind, more vision. We help the CEO turn that vision into shared guardrails, a 30-60-90 scoreboard, and shipped evidence to empower and enhance the value of the entire Executive team.</p>

  <p>Our clients are usually large organizations (enterprises, governments and non-profits) which require operational guardrails against data-exposure, sourcing-bias or vendor lock-in, measurable outcomes to verify market alignment and sustainability, and seasoned strategists to keep the business vision "congruent" with hybrid workflow (human+AI).</p>

  <p>We help you create the plan, and we support delivery in an advisory capacity, supporting but not replacing your project management offices. We help to define systems requirements, solution briefs, RFPs, and we benchmark offerings against global best practices.</p>

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p><strong>InSeed gives CEOs new ways to be CEO.</strong></p>

  <p>We aim to become unnecessary quickly, leaving your organization with continually co-evolving, and self-improving: people, processes, systems, workflows, policies, data, governance, controls, incentives, culture, tooling, training, metrics... All to keep your organization aligned with business growth and stakeholder returns.</p>
