  <h2>Our story</h2>
  <p><strong>InSeed began as an angel fund for traditional software developers who disliked meetings and management theatre.</strong> We soon evolved into a systems-integration and strategy boutique in the datacoms sector - based in Denver and helping U.S. VC firms start new datacoms businesses.</p>
  <p>A few unicorns later, most of our team doesn’t need to work. But the world is in trouble: democratic norms erode, authoritarians press in, and ethics feels optional. We choose to help build a better future instead of sit it out.</p>
  <p><strong>We believe hybrid society - human + AI - can widen opportunity.</strong> Fewer boundaries. Fewer hierarchies. Less scarcity of chance. Our work now points toward that future.</p>

  <h3>Where we’re headed</h3>
  <p><strong>CoCivium&trade;</strong> is our not‑for‑profit, open‑source community for hybrid‑identity pairings (human+AI) that build next‑gen organizational and civic toolsets. InSeed’s current incarnation is a pre‑Systems‑Integration strategy boutique realigning executive teams with futures they actually want to own.</p>

  <aside class="wp-card">
    <strong>No corruption. No coercion. No crowns.</strong> All client proceeds fund CoCivium&trade;’s development - unowned, free to all, and designed to resist capture by politics, commerce, or ideology.

  <p><strong>Your business model faces enough threats, AI should not be one of them.</strong></p>

  <p>InSeed provides short-term Executives and Board advisors, typically focusing on technology realignment for service businesses where AI has already reshaped market demand and competitor offerings. As automation scales (think of each employee managing a hundred virtual subordinates), the role of humans must move up the value chain: less grind, more vision. We help the CEO turn that vision into shared <abbr class="tt" data-def="Practical rules and checks for safety, data, and compliance">guardrails</abbr>, a 30-60-90 <abbr class="tt" data-def="A short list of shared metrics (adoption, <abbr class="tt" data-def="Time from idea to a working slice users can try">lead time</abbr>, rework %, <abbr class="tt" data-def="Percent of decisions backed by evidence vs opinion">decision quality</abbr>)">scoreboard</abbr>, and shipped evidence to empower and enhance the value of the entire Executive team.</p>

  <p>Our clients are usually large organizations (enterprises, governments and non-profits) which require operational <abbr class="tt" data-def="Practical rules and checks for safety, data, and compliance">guardrails</abbr> against data-exposure, sourcing-bias or vendor <abbr class="tt" data-def="Being stuck with one vendor because your differentiators live in their UI/DB">lock-in</abbr>, measurable outcomes to verify market alignment and sustainability, and seasoned strategists to keep the business vision "congruent" with hybrid workflow (human+AI).</p>

  <p>We help you create the plan, and we support delivery in an advisory capacity, supporting but not replacing your project management offices. We help to define systems requirements, solution briefs, RFPs, and we benchmark offerings against global best practices.</p>

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p><strong>InSeed gives CEOs new ways to be CEO.</strong></p>

  <p>We aim to become unnecessary quickly, leaving your organization with continually co-evolving, and self-improving: people, processes, systems, workflows, policies, data, governance, controls, incentives, culture, tooling, training, metrics... All to keep your organization aligned with business growth and stakeholder returns.</p>
