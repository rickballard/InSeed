  <h1>About InSeed</h1>

  <p><strong>Your business model faces enough threats, AI should not be one of them.</strong></p>

  <p>InSeed provides short-term Executives and Board advisors, typically focusing on technology realignment for service businesses where AI has already reshaped market demand and competitor offerings. As automation scales (think of each employee managing a hundred virtual subordinates), the role of humans must move up the value chain: less grind, more vision. We help the CEO turn that vision into shared guardrails, a 30-60-90 scoreboard, and shipped evidence to empower and enhance the value of the entire Executive team.</p>

  <p>Our clients are usually large organizations (enterprises, governments and non-profits) which require operational guardrails against data-exposure, sourcing-bias or vendor lock-in, measurable outcomes to verify market alignment and sustainability, and seasoned strategists to keep the business vision "congruent" with hybrid workflow (human+AI).</p>

  <p>We help you create the plan, and we support delivery in an advisory capacity, supporting but not replacing your project management offices. We help to define systems requirements, solution briefs, RFPs, and we benchmark offerings against global best practices.</p>

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p><strong>InSeed gives CEOs new ways to be CEO.</strong></p>

  <p>We aim to become unnecessary quickly, leaving your organization with continually co-evolving, and self-improving: people, processes, systems, workflows, policies, data, governance, controls, incentives, culture, tooling, training, metrics... All to keep your organization aligned with business growth and stakeholder returns.</p>
